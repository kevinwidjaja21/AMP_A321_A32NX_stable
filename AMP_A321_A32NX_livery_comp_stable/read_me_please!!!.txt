Requirement:

- Fly-by-wire simulation A32NX mod (Any version will work for now but the stable version is recomended for absolute compatibility)
- PMP A321 aircraft
- My "PMP A321 compatibility mod for A32NX stable"

This mod may not work with "Compatibility mod with FBW A32NX for PMP A321" by CptFireAndIce ias the dev version of A32NX has chanegd the interior 3D model compare to the stable one..

Installation (NOT drag and drop):

- Go to the subfolder inside the AMP_A321_whatever_third_party_livery_you_have/SimObjects/Airplanes/whatever_third_party_livery_you_have
- Locate the model.livery_name and texture.livery_name.
- Go inside each folder and rename both model.cfg and texture.cfg to _model.cfg and _texture.cfg. This creates backup of the original cfg files.
- Extract the zip file for this mod.
- Put the NEW model.cfg from this mod zip file inside the model.livery_name
- Put the NEW texture.cfg from this mod zip file inside the texture.livery_name
- Now the livery should be fully compatible with A32NX and have the EFB and cup.

And yes "REPEAT THIS STEP FOR EVERY PMP A321 LIVERY YOU HAVE"

To uninstall the mod if you decided that A32NX compatibility is not needed, simply remove the model.cfg and texture.cfg and rename the _model.cfg and _texture.cfg back to model.cfg and texture.cfg again.
